This folder holds scenes for the Unity project. No binary scene files are added in this PR.

To create the initial scene:
1. Open Unity and create a new scene named "Main".
2. Create a Terrain or Plane and add basic lighting.
3. Create an empty GameObject called "GameManager" and attach Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs.
4. Create a player head (Capsule) named "SnakeHead" and attach Rigidbody + Assets/Scripts/Snake/SnakeController.cs.
   - Configure Rigidbody: Mass ~1, Drag 0.1, Freeze Rotation X/Z (optional).
5. Create a folder Prefabs and add a simple cube/sphere prefab to serve as a segment.
6. Create an empty GameObject named "Segments" and add Assets/Scripts/Snake/SegmentFollower.cs. Assign the head and drag some segment prefabs into the list.
7. Create an empty GameObject called "SpawnManager" and attach Assets/Scripts/Spawn/SpawnManager.cs. Assign some simple food prefabs (sphere scaled small).
8. Create UI canvas and minimal HUD (score text) and wire ScoreManager (create empty GameObject ScoreManager and add the script).

Save the scene as Assets/Scenes/Main.unity
