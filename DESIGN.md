# SerpentX: Evolution — AI-Ready Design & Implementation Roadmap

SerpentX: Evolution is a realistic 3D snake survival game blending physics-driven movement, procedural environments, and adaptive enemy AI. The player grows by consuming items while avoiding hazards and AI enemies. This doc summarizes goals, MVP scope, architecture, AI outlines, and a sprint roadmap.

Goals & MVP
- Realistic 3D snake with physics-linked body segments.
- Procedural arena with configurable wrap/bounds.
- Food and power-ups (Apple, Golden Apple, Toxic Fruit, Shield, Magnet).
- Basic AI: Wild snakes and simple predator drones.
- Score system with combo multiplier and local leaderboard.
- HUD, menus, and performance-conscious spawn manager.

Architecture
- GameManager: global state, pause, restart.
- SnakeController: input -> head movement.
- SegmentFollower: physics/smoothing for body segments.
- SpawnManager: food/powerup spawning.
- ScoreManager: scoring, combos, penalties.
- EnemyManager & AI: spawn and behavior FSMs.
- CameraController: third-person follow + auto-zoom.
- UIManager: HUD, menus, end screen.

AI Overview
- Wild Snake: FSM states (Idle, SeekFood, Attack, Flee). Uses navmesh/A* on ground.
- Predator Drone: ranged attacks, raycast targeting.
- Flying Predator: altitude-aware pursuit attempting to grab tail segments.

Scoring
- Score = (SumFoodPoints × ComboMultiplier) + (EnemyKills × 100) + (SurvivalTimeSeconds × 10) - DamagePenalties
- Combo increments when food is collected within a combo window (e.g. 3s). Max multiplier ×5.

Sprints (initial)
- Sprint 0: repo scaffolding, Unity project setup
- Sprint 1: core movement, camera, segment chain
- Sprint 2: food, scoring, spawn manager
- Sprint 3: basic AI and enemy framework
- Sprint 4: HUD, menus, settings persistence
- Sprint 5: environment, LOD, optimization
- Sprint 6: polish and release prep

Notes
- Target engine: Unity (2021 LTS+). Language: C#.
- Use kinematic/rigidbody hybrid for segments and enable LOD + culling for performance.
- This doc is a summary; expand each system with class diagrams and task lists in issues.
